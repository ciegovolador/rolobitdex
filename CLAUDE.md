# CLAUDE.md

## gstack

Use the `/browse` skill from gstack for all web browsing. Never use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools.

If gstack skills aren't working, run `cd .claude/skills/gstack && ./setup` to build the binary and register skills.

### Development Lifecycle: Plan → Build → Verify → Ship

Full specs: `openspec/specs/gstack-lifecycle/`, `openspec/specs/review-gates/`, `openspec/specs/skill-chaining/`

| Phase | Skills | When to use |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Plan** | `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-bitcoiner-review`, `/plan-cypherpunk-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/plan-automation-tester-review`, `/plan-a11y-auditor-review`, `/plan-design-review`, `/design-consultation` | Before implementation — scope, sovereignty, security, architecture, testing, accessibility, design |
| **Build** | `/opsx:propose`, `/opsx:apply`, `/opsx:explore` | Create OpenSpec change, implement tasks, explore ideas |
| **Verify** | `/qa`, `/qa-only`, `/design-review`, `/review`, `/browse` | After implementation — functional, visual, and code safety |
| **Ship** | `/ship`, `/document-release`, `/retro`, `/opsx:archive` | Release, update docs, retrospect, archive change |

### Build in Isolation (Frontend)

All new frontend component work MUST start in Storybook. The workflow:
1. Create the component and its `.stories.tsx` file in `src/components/`
2. Run `npm run storybook` (port 6006) and verify the component renders correctly in isolation
3. Only then integrate the component into app screens
4. When modifying existing components, verify changes in Storybook before checking app integration

Every interactive component in `src/components/` SHALL have a colocated `.stories.tsx` file. Components with controlled state (e.g., modals) SHALL use a `render` function with local state in their story.

Spec: `openspec/specs/storybook-dev-workflow/`

### Autonomous Workflow Convention

Claude SHALL work as an autonomous company — running the full lifecycle for every change without waiting for manual skill invocations between phases.

#### `/opsx:propose` — Full Pipeline Start
When `/opsx:propose` is invoked, Claude SHALL automatically:
1. **Branch**: Create branch using `SCOPE/IP-NUMBER-DESCRIPTION` convention:
   - `git checkout main && git pull`
   - Determine SCOPE from change description: `feature` (new functionality), `bugfix` (fix broken behavior), `hotfix` (urgent production fix), `release` (version/release prep). Default: `feature`.
   - Find next IP number: scan `git branch -a` for highest `IP-\d+`, increment, zero-pad to 3 digits (001, 002, ...). Start at 001 if none exist.
   - `git checkout -b SCOPE/IP-NUMBER-DESCRIPTION`
   - Examples: `feature/IP-001-branch-naming`, `bugfix/IP-002-fix-trade-status`, `hotfix/IP-003-backup-crash`
2. **Plan Reviews**: Analyze the change description and run ALL relevant reviews:
   - **Always**: `/plan-eng-review`
   - **If UI** (components, screens, styles): `/plan-design-review` + `/plan-a11y-auditor-review`
   - **If Bitcoin** (payments, addresses, trades, protocol): `/plan-bitcoiner-review`
   - **If Security** (data storage, keys, crypto, networking): `/plan-cypherpunk-review`
   - **If Testable** (user flows, DB operations, test files): `/plan-automation-tester-review`
   - **If Product** (new features, scope changes, business decisions): `/plan-ceo-review`
3. **Build**: Generate OpenSpec artifacts (proposal, design, specs, tasks)

Work stays local — no commit or push.

#### `/opsx:apply` — Autonomous Implementation
Claude works through all tasks using all necessary tools (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Grep, Glob, Agent). No manual intervention required between tasks. Work stays local.

#### `/opsx:archive` — Commit, Push & Close
When `/opsx:archive` is invoked, Claude SHALL:
1. Sync delta specs to main specs
2. Move change to archive
3. Commit all uncommitted work
4. Push branch to origin

### Skill Chaining Patterns

**Full Bitcoin feature** (product + sovereignty + security + architecture + testing + a11y + UI):
`/plan-ceo-review` → `/plan-bitcoiner-review` → `/plan-cypherpunk-review` → `/plan-eng-review` → `/plan-automation-tester-review` → `/plan-a11y-auditor-review` → `/plan-design-review` → `/opsx:propose` → `/opsx:apply` → `/qa` → `/design-review` → `/ship`

**Bitcoin protocol change** (no UI):
`/plan-bitcoiner-review` → `/plan-cypherpunk-review` → `/plan-eng-review` → `/plan-automation-tester-review` → `/opsx:propose` → `/opsx:apply` → `/review` → `/ship`

**Security-focused change** (key handling, encryption, backup):
`/plan-cypherpunk-review` → `/plan-eng-review` → `/plan-automation-tester-review` → `/opsx:propose` → `/opsx:apply` → `/review` → `/ship`

**General feature** (product + architecture + testing + a11y + UI, no Bitcoin protocol):
`/plan-ceo-review` → `/plan-eng-review` → `/plan-automation-tester-review` → `/plan-a11y-auditor-review` → `/plan-design-review` → `/opsx:propose` → `/opsx:apply` → `/qa` → `/design-review` → `/ship`

**UI-focused change** (components/screens with no Bitcoin protocol):
`/plan-eng-review` → `/plan-a11y-auditor-review` → `/plan-design-review` → `/opsx:propose` → `/opsx:apply` → `/qa` → `/design-review` → `/ship`

**Trivial fix** (< 20 lines, config, typo):
`/ship` (includes its own pre-landing review)

### Review Gates

- **Eng Review** (`/plan-eng-review`): Required — gates `/ship` by default. Override per-branch or globally (`gstack-config set skip_eng_review true`).
- **CEO Review** (`/plan-ceo-review`): Informational — recommended for product/scope changes, never blocks shipping.
- **Design Review** (`/plan-design-review`): Informational — recommended when diff includes frontend files, never blocks shipping.
- **Bitcoiner Review** (`/plan-bitcoiner-review`): Informational — recommended for changes touching payments, addresses, trades, or Bitcoin protocol. Rates: Sovereignty, Privacy, Trustlessness, Fee Control, Ethos.
- **Cypherpunk Review** (`/plan-cypherpunk-review`): Informational — recommended for changes touching data storage, networking, key material, or cryptography. Rates: Threat Model, Metadata Minimization, Crypto Hygiene, Zero-Knowledge Defaults, Opsec.
- **Automation Tester Review** (`/plan-automation-tester-review`): Informational — recommended for changes touching testable user flows, database operations, or test files. Rates: Test Coverage, Regression Safety, E2E Readiness, Testability, CI Integration.
- **A11y Auditor Review** (`/plan-a11y-auditor-review`): Informational — recommended for changes touching UI components, screens, or styles. Rates: Screen Reader Support, Semantic Structure, Interaction Accessibility, Visual Accessibility, Motion & Focus Management.
